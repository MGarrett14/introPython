Program Python Project:
About
My program works simialr as a vpn, my program will take in the website the user wants to enter, then will give the user the option to choose a country to be while in the website. The vpn will generate an ip address for that location, then if there is a virus at that location/ip address it will ask the user if it wants to change locations or not, if the user stays in the website it will let the user continue to browse the website and be at risk of a virus.

Features
The features of my program is being able to self generate an ip address without me manually having to input ip address. This makes it easier for the user to get an ip, without going through a long process or having to choose a certain ip. The user is able to switch locations if they don't feel statified with that location, or there is a potential virus in that area, so the user can switch locations. The program also blocks out pop out ads that can give a potential virus, and wanring the user of a potential virus while blocking out those ads.

1. What inspiried you (or your team) to develop this program ?
The apps like Nordvpn and Surfshark inspiried me to develop this program, because these programs are very useful on protecting people from a lot fo internet hackers, and I also want to help. People are very vulnerable on the internet and one simple mistake can easily let a user lose all their private information. I want to stop that from happening to so many users and to keep internet users safe from any malicious virus and or hackers and keep all their info safe and private.

2. What was a road block that you had with writing your program? How did you solve your problem?
The road block I had with writing my program is making the program generate it's own ip address for the user. as I did not understand what an ip was and had to learn about that, and originally I was going to manually write the ip addresses, but that would be way too time consuming and look messy in the code. I looked up  for help and learned how to make a self generating ip in python. The more I was taught the easier it got and I eventually made the self-generating ip on my own.

3. What is somthing you would have liked to have added or done differently?
    Something I would to have done added is the user getting a virus somehow and the virus looping until the user leaves the website. This would have showed how useful a vpn is on prtecting users from viruses and how dangerous a virus can be and which is why user should be more cautious. I would have made a wider range of  choices to pick for the countries the user is picking, so the user doesn't feel stressed that all of the locations have a virus and can't choose a different one and will be forced to be stuck in a location with a virus,
