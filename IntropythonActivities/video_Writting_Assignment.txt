Early Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #1:
I learned many things from the video and I learned a lot about the origin of computers, and how they worked when they were first becoming a things,
but there are three facts I find the most interesting throughout the whole video, one of those facts are the abacus. The abacus
was invented in Mesopotamia around 2500 BCE, this compute was made to add, subtract, and to just keep track of the population at the time,
since the populatiom was increasing rapidly and lots of people were there around that time.
