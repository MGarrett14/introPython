# 1. In your on words, describe what a variable is.
A; variable is a container for different values you put into a prograam
# 2. Name three (3) operators we've learned about in class and describe 
Three operators we've learned in class is mathmatic operator-symbols used to allow programmmers
to perform math operations, Assignment operator- symbols used to assian a variable to a value,
and Comparison operator- symbols used to compare values
# a situation where you would use each one. 
you would used the mathmatic operator when making a math problem, a assignment operator to assign
a variable like Numberofcarrots=22, you would use a comparion operator to see if a variable is larger
than the other like 24>2

# 3. Describe the difference between camal case and pascal case.
The difference between camal case and pascal case is that, camal case you capitalize every new word,

# 4. Which operator is being used in the example below

# 5. You have been given a $100.00 dollar gift card from a family member. Another 
# family member adds 50.00 dollars to your gift card and a friend gives you $35.50. 
# Your task is to create variables for each gift amount and a final variable that
# represents the total amount of money on your gift card. 
GiftCardFromAmountFamilyMember= 100
GiftCardFromAmountAnotherFamilyMember= 50
GiftCardAmountFromFriend= 35.50
TotalAmountFromAllGiftCards= 185.50

# 6. Create a variable that uses the input function and then print that variable. Your variable 
# should ask a user to enter their name.  
NameofPerson = input('What is your name?')

# 7. You have been asked to create a program for a community center that wants to plan a cookout. 
# The community center wants you to build a form program and capture several key data points. 
# They want to know a visitor's full name, their age, if they have an allergy, and what their 
# favorite food is. You need to create the appropriate varialbes with the appropriate data type
# and use the input() function and print function to take in and print out the user's responses. 
FullNameofVisitors = input('What is your full name?')
AgeofVisitors = input('How old are you?')
AllergiesofVisitors

# 8. You have been given a job to create a program for a sandwich shop. The sandwich shop
# wants to be able to know if a user has a gluten allegery before they make the sandwich order.
# If the user DOES have a glutten allergy, they need to eat a special type of bread, if the user DOES NOT
# have an allergy they can eat the regular bread. What data type would best be used in this 
# scenario and how would you write a variable to represent this value?

# 9. In your own words, describe what a program is?

# 10. Describe the difference between a float and an integer.
