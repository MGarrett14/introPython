breifly describe what your program is about?
My program called 'Equation solver'  and it is designed to break down an equation, step by step and will go through the problem with you so you can understand how the equation works and how to get the answer. The program can solve more than one equation at once, and can even give more than one way to solve an equation so you can have a better understand on how to solve it. This program can be very helpful for all ages, no matter how long, or tedious the problem 'Equation solver' will walk you through it, help you, and get it done efficintely.



What problem is your program trying to solve?
There are several problems my program is trying to aim for, but one of the main problems my program is trying to solve is helping scientist that can't solve a difficult equations, with the help of this program scientist can solve real world problems that deal with equations like caculating the weight or amounts of different non-earth materials. These could help solve even bigger problems the world is facing. My program is always trying to help people who struggle to understand math since math is one of the most important subjects, that everyone should learn and know about and this can even help kids with their education in math.



How will your program solve this problem?
Equation solver will solve these problems by  



Are there any apps that similar to your program?
There are several programs that inspired me to make this program, one is a caculator, a caculator can give an answer to any equation/probem you put into it and this was a big inspiration for me to make my program. Another program that inspired me to make this is Cadabra
