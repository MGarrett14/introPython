Program Python Project:
About
My program works simialr as a vpn, my program will take in the website the user wants to enter, then will give the user the option to choose a country to be while in the website. The vpn will generate an ip address for that location, then if there is a virus at that location/ip address it will ask the user if it wants to change locations or not, if the user stays in the website it will let the user continue to browse the website and be at risk of a virus.

Features
The features of my program is being able to self generate an ip address without me manually having to input ip address. This makes it easier for the user to get an ip, without going through a long process or having to choose a certain ip. The user is able to switch locations if they don't feel statified with that location, or there is a potential virus in that area, so the user can switch locations. The program also blocks out pop out ads that can give a potential virus, and wanring the user of a potential virus while blocking out those ads.

What inspiried you (or your team) to develop this program ?
The apps like Nordvpn and Surfshark inspiried me to develop this program, because these programs are very useful on protecting people from a lot fo internet hackers, and I also want to help. People are very vulnerable on the internet and one simple mistake can easily let a user lose all their private information. I want to stop that from happening to so many users
