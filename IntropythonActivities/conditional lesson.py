# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function
'The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter is a placeholder.'
'A argument is  when you bring facts into a function'
# 2. In your own words, describe what
# a conditional statement (if/else) is ' 
'A conditional statement (if/else) is if you try something to a statement that is true it will work'
'But if you try something else that isnt right it will not work'
'Conditional statement- executes a block of code if a specific condition is met'

# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
money_on_card = 2000.00
price_of_album = 800.00

if money_on_card > price_of_album
      print('congrats, you got the new album.')

else:
      print('sorry, insufficient funds.')

# 4. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean. 
def put_food_in_refridegerator(food_in_refridgerator):
   if food_in_refridegerator == True:
     
      print('time to cook!')

else:
print('time to shop')

put_food_in_refridgerator(false)




# 5. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should have a parameter that accepts an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".

# keyword= parameter, integer, function, print, conditional statement, inventory,
# comparison using more than

def cereal_inventory(cereal):
     current_cereal_inventory= 10
     if : cereal >= current-cereal_inventory:
          print('Inventory is full.')
     
     
     else : print('need ot order more cereal')
